When the workshop begins, you should be sharing your screen,
and instruct the learners to make sure their setup looks like yours:

1. A new VS Code window is open (taking up the left 75% of the screen)
2. A browser window with GitHub is open (taking up the right 75% of the screen)

In your browser window, you can have a second tab open with all images for
this workshop, available at [this URL](http://jennajordan.me/git-novice-speedrun/instructor/images.html)

## Create a new repo on GitHub

The first thing we need to do is create a new repository. While you can create repositories locally, and never even connect the local repo to a remote repo (hosted on a site like GitHub), the simplist and most common pattern to first create a new repo on GitHub, and then clone that repo to your local computer.

You should already be signed in to GitHub. You can create a new repo from anywhere on the site by clicking on the "+" icon in the upper right, and then clicking "New Repository":
