- Define the terms fork, clone, origin, remote, upstream
- Understand how to make a pull request and what they are useful for

:::::::::::::::: callout

Pull requests are a great way to collaborate with others using github.
Instead of making changes directly to a repository you can suggest changes to a repo.
This can be useful if you don't have permission to modify a repository directly or
you want someone else to review your changes.

:::::::::::::::::::::

On GitHub, in your `planets` repo, **click on the "Pull Requests" tab**. 

Then **click "New pull request"**. Alternatively, GitHub will see your new branch with recent changes and will prompt you to "Compare & pull request". Click this button to also be taken to the new pull request page.

Make sure that the "base" branch is `main` and the "compare" branch is `pythondev`.

Next, we need to give our PR a title. By default, your PR will get the title from your last commit. We can leave this as is.

We can leave a note in the PR description, like:

"The python analysis was faster than the bash analysis, so I am merging only the python analysis to main".

**Click "Create pull request"**.

Your planets repo should now have 1 pull request. This is the phase where you would normally request a reviewer, who can leave comments on your code. In repos that you do not own, your PR will need to be approved by a codeowner before you can merge it. Since you are the codeowner, we can go ahead and **click "Merge pull request"**.

Go back to the "Code" tab and make sure you are on the "main" branch. You should now see an "analysis.py" file.

Let's go **back to VS Code**. Checkout the main branch, and look at the files and history:

```bash
$ git checkout main
$ git log --oneline
```

```output
e98a594 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy
33d27e2 Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman
7e1e559 Start notes on Mars as a base
```

The analysis file is not on "main" yet. This is because we need to first pull the changes we made with the Pull Request from the remote repository.

```bash
$ git pull
$ git log --oneline
```

```output
d980f78 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) Merge pull request #1 from vlad/pythondev
d5f2565 (origin/pythondev, pythondev) Wrote and tested python analysis script
e98a594 Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy
33d27e2 Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman
7e1e559 Start notes on Mars as a base
```

Now our main branch is up to date.

## Deleting branches

Now that we've merged the `pythondev` into `main`, these changes
exist in both branches. This could be confusing in the future if we
stumble upon the `pythondev` branch again.

We can delete our old branches so as to avoid this confusion later.
We can do so by adding the `-d` flag to the `git branch` command.

```bash
git branch -d pythondev
```

```output
Deleted branch pythondev (was x792csa1).
```

And because we don't want to keep the changes in the `bashdev` branch,
we can delete the `bashdev` branch as well

```bash
$ git branch -d bashdev
```

```output
error: The branch 'bashdev' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D bashdev'.
```

Since we've never merged the changes from the `bashdev` branch,
git warns us about deleting them and tells us to use the `-D` flag instead.

Since we really want to delete this branch we will go ahead and do so.

```bash
git branch -D bashdev
```

```output
Deleted branch bashdev (was 2n779ds).
```

Finally, we can also delete the pythondev branch **on GitHub. Click on "Branches"**, and to delete the `pythondev` branch **click the trashcan icon** to the right of the branch name.
